# Projects

My projects serve primarily as laboratories for improving my skill set as a software architect. For this reason their repositories remain private. Presently, two of them have had a significant impact in their role.

## Calorie

A nutrition tracking service consisting of a frontend and backend implementation.

## Object Calisthenics

An experiment in rigorious object-oriented design, following a set of [nine rules](https://williamdurand.fr/2013/06/03/object-calisthenics/).
